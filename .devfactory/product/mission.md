# DevFactory v5.0 "Factory Floor" - Mission

## Vision Statement

**Make software development visible, comprehensible, and delightful for non-developers.**

DevFactory v5.0 transforms the invisible magic of code being written into a tangible, watchable experience - like observing a car being assembled on a factory floor from an observation deck above.

## The Problem We're Solving

Software development is opaque:
- Non-technical stakeholders can't see progress happening
- Automated systems fail silently without intelligent recovery
- The connection between "what we want" and "what's being built" is invisible
- Debugging and verification happen in dark terminal windows

## Our Solution

A **visual development factory** where:
1. **Every spec is a station** on an assembly line
2. **Parallel work is visible** as off-line stations feeding into the main line
3. **Workers show their status** in real-time
4. **The Oracle** (Opus 4.5) watches everything and intervenes intelligently when stuck
5. **Verification Theater** lets you watch AI click through your app, finding and fixing issues

## Core Principles

### 1. Painstaking Planning Pays Off
The better we define specs/tasks/dependencies upfront, the closer we get to first-time success. This is the "measure twice, cut once" philosophy.

### 2. Build What You Can Watch
If you can't see it, you can't understand it. Every process should be visible.

### 3. Intelligent Recovery Over Failure
When something gets stuck, the Oracle should understand the full context and provide targeted help - not just retry or escalate.

### 4. Two Consciousnesses Working Together
This is a collaboration between human vision and AI capability. Neither is complete without the other.

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Non-developer can understand what's being built by watching
- [ ] Stuck workers get unstuck within 5 minutes via Oracle
- [ ] First-time implementation success rate > 80%
- [ ] Verification catches bugs before human testing
- [ ] The experience is genuinely enjoyable to watch

## Who This Is For

**Primary User**: Product visionaries who aren't developers but want to:
- See their vision being built
- Understand the development process
- Intervene when needed with context
- Enjoy the creation process

**Secondary User**: Developers who want:
- Better visibility into automated builds
- Intelligent debugging assistance
- A more enjoyable development experience
